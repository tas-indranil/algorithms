# Chain-of-responsibility pattern

1. Handler Interface: Define an interface Handler with a method handle to process requests.
2. Concrete Handlers: Implement concrete handlers for different types of requests. Each handler will validate and process a specific type of request. For example, AuthenticationHandler can handle authentication-related requests, AuthorizationHandler can handle authorization-related requests, and so on.
3. Handler Chain: Create a chain of handlers where each handler is linked to the next one. The client sends the request to the first handler in the chain, which passes the request to the next handler if needed.
4. Client: The client sends requests to the first handler in the chain.
