# Scenario
Consider a scenario where you have different rendering engines (e.g., HTML, JSON, XML) and different web UI frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Materialize) that can be used to render web pages. The Bridge Pattern can be used to separate the abstraction of rendering engines from the implementation of web UI frameworks.

# Benefits
1. **Decoupling Abstraction and Implementation:** One of the primary benefits of the Bridge Pattern is that it decouples the abstraction (high-level module) from its implementation (low-level module), allowing them to vary independently. This separation enhances flexibility and makes the system more maintainable.
2. **Enhanced Extensibility**
3. **Platform Independence**: By separating the abstraction from its implementation, it becomes easier to support multiple platforms without duplicating code or introducing platform-specific dependencies.

# Drawbacks
1. **Increased Complexity**
2. **Potential Overhead**: The Bridge Pattern introduces an additional layer of abstraction, which may incur a slight performance overhead compared to direct coupling between components.
3. **Increased Development Time** _[very vey important]_


###### Footnote: difference between Adapter patterns. and Bridge pattern
1. Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another, Bridge Pattern separates an abstraction from its implementation
2. Adapter Pattern used in integrating legacy systems with modern systems, working with third-party libraries with incompatible interfaces. Where Bridge Pattern used at separating platform-independent code from platform-specific code, implementing a plugin system, creating a UI framework that can support multiple rendering engines
3. Adapter Pattern helps to make incompatible interfaces work together, Bridge Pattern helps to make abstractions and implementations vary independently
