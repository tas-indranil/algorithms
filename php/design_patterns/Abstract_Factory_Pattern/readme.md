# Benefits of the Abstract Factory Pattern:

1. Encapsulates object creation, providing a clear separation of concerns.
2. Allows easy switching between different families of related objects.
3. Promotes consistency in object creation throughout the application.

# Drawbacks:

1. Adding new product variants may require modifying existing code, violating the Open/Closed Principle.
2. The pattern can lead to the creation of large hierarchies of interfaces and classes, which can become complex to manage in larger systems.
