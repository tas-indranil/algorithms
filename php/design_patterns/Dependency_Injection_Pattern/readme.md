# Benefits of Dependency Injection:
1. <b>Increased Testability</b>: Dependency injection makes it easier to test components in isolation by allowing dependencies to be replaced with mocks or stubs during testing.
2. <b>Improved Code Reusability</b>: Components are loosely coupled, making it easier to reuse them in different contexts or applications.
3. <b>Enhanced Flexibility</b>: Dependencies can be easily swapped or modified without changing the core logic of the component.
# Drawbacks of Dependency Injection:
1. <b>Complexity</b>: Implementing dependency injection can introduce additional complexity, especially in large applications with many dependencies.
2. <b>Configuration Overhead</b>: Managing and configuring dependencies can require additional effort and infrastructure, such as dependency injection containers.
3. <b>Runtime Performance</b>: Dependency injection may introduce a slight runtime performance overhead due to the need for additional object creation and management.
